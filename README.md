# PROGIDY_SD_02 Project

## Output

The Guessing Game is a desktop application developed in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. Each time the user enters a guess, the application provides feedback such as “Too High” or “Too Low” until the correct number is guessed. Once the user guesses correctly, the game displays a congratulatory message along with the total number of attempts taken. This project uses Java Swing components like JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JLabel, and implements event handling through ActionListener to process user input and button clicks. The main objective of the project is to create an interactive and user-friendly guessing game that demonstrates the use of GUI programming, random number generation, and event-driven logic in Java. It is a simple yet effective project that showcases fundamental programming concepts while providing an engaging experience for the user.
